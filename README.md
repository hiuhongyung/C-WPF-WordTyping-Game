# C-WPF-WordTyping-Game
In this typing game, I used a restaurant-setup as my theme and created a word typing game.
![Starting Page](https://github.com/hiuhongyung/CSharp-WPF-WordTyping-Game/blob/main/screenshots/starting_page.png)

In the starting page of the game. There are two buttons in the page. One is “Start Game” and the other one is “About”. Once you pressed the “Start Game” button, the game will begin and you can start typing!!:) On the other hand, I’ve added the “About” Section to introduce the game and give a hands-on background information to the player.

After reading the description, you can press the “back” icon and go back to the starting page. Then, we can start playing the game!!

First off, you can see the timer in the left hand corner. I have set one minute as the game time. It will keep counting down. After one minute, the game will stop. 

Meanwhile, you can see four text blocks in the window which are the word that you need to type, somewhere you can, number of correct typing and number of incorrect typing respectively. 

I have created a 20 words dictionary in the game and it will show up in the text block randomly. The words are all related to some frequently used IT terminology. (Probably now you know the game is designed for us) 

In the game, there will be a tracker and keep tracker how many words you type correct or incorrect in the game and show them into the corresponding text block. 

Meanwhile, I have added some background music and try to make the game be more interesting. At the same time, I have added different sound effects on typing the word Correct and Wrong. Try to listen it but avoid typing wrong

Lastly, after one minute, a pop up window will be displayed and show how much words you have typed correctly in the game.
